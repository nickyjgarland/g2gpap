# Suggested reading

The titles in this section are intended to get the student started in the field of digital aerial photography and remote sensing data handling. The basic texts are Wilson (1982) and (2000) for aerial photography and Lillesand and Kiefer 1994 for aerial photography, remote sensing and image processing. The former is still the best introductory source available; the latter is a clear, cheap, and lavishly illustrated handbook unrivalled for the past 20 years.

For more in-depth reading, the UK student should consult Palmer and Cox (1993) and Bewley (1993), who provide an overview of current aerial photography use in professional archaeology; Scollar et al. (1990), which provides full technical background to all the important processing steps for both types of data; and, lastly, the manuals that go with the software the student will be using – these nearly always have general sections explaining how various types of digital data are collected, how they are structured, what their limitations are, and what approach the software makers have taken toward solving particular types of problems.

The French student may find Agache (1978), Barisano (1988), Chevallier (1964), and Chouquer (1996) interesting starting points. The German student may find Esch (1997) or Scollar (1965) useful starting points.
