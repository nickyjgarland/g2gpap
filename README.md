# Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the Guide to Good Practice for Aerial Survey. The guide and this repository is maintined by staff at the [Archaeology Data Service](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/).

# About the guide

The primary aim of the Guides to Good Practice is to provide information on the best way to create, manage, and document digital material produced during the course of an archaeological project. The ultimate aim of the Guides is to improve the practice of depositing and preserving digital information safely within an archive for future use. Further information about the guides and their history can be found on the [homepage](https://nickyjgarland.github.io/g2gpap/index.html) of this Guide to Good Practice.

This document is intended to be a Guide to Good Practice for the creation and preservation of digital resources resulting from aerial photography (incorporating optical and infra-red imagery collected from an airborne platform), satellite and airborne remote sensing (using a variety of sensors), and archaeological interpretations made from such data sources. For further details please read ['About this guide'](https://nickyjgarland.github.io/g2gpap/content/0_about_guide.html) within the manual.
